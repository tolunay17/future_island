    name: 'Boy Pablo',
    synopsis: 'boy pablo hails from Bergen in Norway, renowned for being the rainiest city in Europe, with an average rainfall of 250 days a year. You’d think this would inevitably weigh on the mood of its inhabitants, but it seems to have had the opposite effect on Nicolas Pablo Muñoz. The young singer-songwriter with Chilean roots has the natural cheerfulness of Mac DeMarco, Ween or - to go a long way back in time - Jonathan Richman. Although he mostly writes and records his sunny indie pop alone, Pablo loves to perform live with four old school friends. His music found its way into the world with ‘Everytime’ (2017). The accompanying video has been watched more than 30 million times. In Norway, boy pablo is already a national hero, and the rest of the world is bound to follow with his debut album ‘Wachito Rico’ (2020).',

    name: 'Girl in red',
    synopsis: 'In September 2017, Marie Ulven Ringheim realised she was in love with her best friend. She saw her in the distance at a concert and sent a text saying ‘girl in red’. Nothing came of it. But that moment of excitement and longing had a strong influence on her music from then on, says the Norwegian in her twenties. And she also had a readymade name for the songs she wrote in her bedroom on the guitar her grandfather had given her for her birthday when she was a teenager. Her first single ‘I Wanna Be Your Girlfriend’ was considered one of the best songs of 2018. It expressed the aspirations of many of her contemporaries and turned Ringheim into a beacon for the LGBT community. That may seem weighty but her songs are nimble and humorous, first and foremost. Her debut album ‘World In Red’ comes out in October.',

    name: 'Gorillaz',
    synopsis: 'Everyone agreed after Gorillaz blew the roof off the Werchter stage in 2018 - the brainchild of comic artist Jamie Hewlett and Blur’s Damon Albarn is one of the best live acts ever. Some of the headlines: ‘So much grandeur’. ‘An infectious carnival’. ‘Dancing towards a better world’. Shortly afterwards, Albarn announced that we shouldn’t expect too much over the next ten years. Then in January this year, they presented the musical concept ‘Song Machine’. And next year, the first virtual band in history is heading back out on tour. From now on, Gorillaz will release music in episodes, whenever new material is ready. Each episode features a different guest:  in 2020 the likes of slowthai, Fatoumata Diaware, Peter Hook (New Order), Georgia and Octavian joined forces with the band.',

    name: 'The Lumineers',
    synopsis: '‘Ho Hey’ by The Lumineers was one of the sounds of 2012. The American folk-rock band are as meteoric at winning hearts as the not entirely dissimilar Mumford & Sons. Around the world ‘Ho Hey’ dominated the charts for a seriously long time - in the US alone it clocked up 62 weeks and five million copies. The reason for that success, people say, is the authenticity of The Lumineers. Acoustic instruments, cuddly people, brilliant anthems. But their cheerful banjo pop also has depth to it. Drummer Jeremiah Fraites’ brother Josh was guitarist Wesley Schutz’s best friend. When Josh died of an overdose in 2002, Jeremiah and Wesley found solace in the music they created together. At home in America today, The Lumineers are a stalwart, and Jack White has declared himself to be a fan. The excellent album ‘III’ (2019) should rekindle the European connection.',
